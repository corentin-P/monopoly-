I must do :
- the tkinter app to build houses and hotels
- the system of the chance and community chest cards
- link the launcher to the game (money for the go case and money at the beginning are already done)
- the swap system (swap cards during the game to have families of cards and can build)
- the jail system
- the park system


I must do better:
- the changing of players (if there is a twice, the same player replay, else, we change of player)


More ideas :
- do a chat between the players
- do an online game
- add some music and sounds


I've done:
- The drawing of the board
- The player class and objects
- The system of movements of the players
- The money system and the salary system when we pass by the go case
- The shopping system
- The payment system between the players
- A part of the launcher
